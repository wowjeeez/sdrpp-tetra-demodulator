# sdrpp-tetra-demodulator
Tetra demodulator plugin for SDR++
need to build it  
Designed to fully demodulate and decode TETRA downlink signals

Thanks to osmo-tetra authors for their great library

Signal chain:

VFO->Demodulator(AGC->FLL->RRC->Maximum Likelihood(y[n]y'[n]) timing recovery->Costas loop)->Constellation diagram->Symbol extractor->Differential decoder->Bits unpacker->Osmo-tetra decoder->Sink

Binary installing:

Visit the Actions page, find latest commit build artifacts, download tetra_demodulator.so and put it to /usr/lib/sdrpp/plugins/, skipping to the step 4. Don't forget to install libtalloc!

Building:

  0.  If you have arch-like system, just install package sdrpp-tetra-demodulator-git with all dependencies.

      OR 

  1.  Install SDR++ core headers to /usr/include/sdrpp_core/, if not installed. Refer to https://cropinghigh.github.io/sdrpp-moduledb/headerguide.html about how to do that

      OR if you don't want to use my header system, add -DSDRPP_MODULE_CMAKE="/path/to/sdrpp_build_dir/sdrpp_module.cmake" to cmake launch arguments

      Download and patch ETSI TETRA codec(in this repository):

          cd src/decoder/etsi_codec-patches
          ./download_and_patch.sh

      Install libtalloc-dev/talloc via package manager

  2.  Build:

          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
          make
          sudo make install

  4.  Enable new module by adding it via Module manager

Usage:

  1.  Find TETRA frequency you want to receive

  2.  Move demodulator VFO to the center of it

  3.  After some time, it will sync to the carrier and you'll likely see 4 constellation points(sync requires at least ~20dB of signal)

  4.  If the channel is unencrypted, just wait for the voice activity and listen to it!
